* Define CI, Continious Delivery & Continious Deployment
Answer :
continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
Continuous delivery is also a software development practice that uses automation to speed the release of new code. It establishes a process through which a developer's changes to an application can be pushed to a code repository or container registry through automation.
continuous deployment automates the process of releasing code updates to production. For continuous deployment to work, you need to devote a lot of resources to automated tests, because it removes the manual gate before code deployment.
